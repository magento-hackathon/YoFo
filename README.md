# Caution

this version will not run on your machine.
We depend on some crazy nonsense which uses a core modified magento


# What is this about?


### the name?

 because of yoke and focusing


### What should it be?

a Webapplication for tracking, managing and organizing Forks and Patches


### Why?

because the Community Work of Magento happens without much interest in the community itself.
We have Events sponsored and strongly inlfuented by the Company behind Magento,
and still it needs more then a Year to actually include the patches into the Magento Project.

We had a few trys for a Fork of Magento.  
Some which only wanted to maintain Bugfixes.  
Some which actually tried to improve magento.


none of them got enough support to become an community accepted alternative, but we now have several Forks.
All of them with an individual collection of bugfixes and improvements.
Also there will be new Magento versions, which fixes some of the issues, but without info which of them.

This Project should give a base for future forks, to be more successfull.
This happens by reducing the work needed to collect and compare patches by cross referencing them.
It will make it possible to reference patches to changesets from official magento releases, to keep track which
problems got fixed and which not.
It will implement a community based review System, to ensure security and integrity of the whole codebase.
